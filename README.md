## Overview

Create ANSI art/logos by drawing them in Microsoft Excel

## Requirements

## Usage

- Draw out your logo/splash screen using <bold>cell highlighting</bold> for colored characters
- Set the width and height of the logo
- Set what character to use for empty white cells, and what character to use for empty colored cells

## Compatability

Not all terminals support true color, though many do. [Here](https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728) is a list of terminals that do and do not support true color.

## Why Excel

The spreadsheet in excel make for a convenient GUI for 'drawing' logos pixel by pixel, which can then be processed with VBA commands to produce the ANSI sequence.
